                **Tuberculosis (TB)** is a potentially serious infectious disease that primarily affects the lungs. It is caused by the bacterium *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. Early and accurate detection of TB is crucial for effective treatment and preventing its spread.

                Chest X-rays are commonly used in screening, but interpretation requires trained professionals. This application uses **deep learning** to assist in detecting TB from X-ray images.

                ### ðŸ¤– Why VGG16?
                - **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained on ImageNet, VGG16 extracts strong features even from small medical datasets.
                - **Deep Feature Extraction**: Captures fine-grained patterns and structural details.
                - **Good Generalization**: Performs well on unseen data after fine-tuning.
                - **Deployable**: Easy to integrate into apps and services like this one.
